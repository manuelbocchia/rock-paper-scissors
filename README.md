# rock-paper-scissors

This Rock Paper Scissors game is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

In the first instance, I built the game to be played with alerts and all the instructions appearing in the console.

Now I'm moving on towards a more useful UI so that anyone can play the game, even on mobile.

As soon as that's done, I'll update the readme.

LOG #1:
First I need to organize myself. My game is working, but I'm gonna have to rework the code so that it works with DOM and buttons.
So first the buttons.
Then the results.
